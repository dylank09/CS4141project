This repository is for a programming assignment in the module CS4141 - Introduction to programming.
It introduces many aspects of the language java such as arrays, methods, different classes and many more. 

The programming assignment is based on Microsoft Excel and it's sheets (or tabs). The mainClassProj class performs many functions on the sheets array. For example, add or remove a sheet to the array, move sheets around, rename sheets etc.

Requirements:
  Each sheet must be unique (not case sensitive). 
  Sheet names can include the characters A to Z, upper and lower case; the digits 0 to 9 and space. 
  There must always be at least one sheet.
  The default sheets are initially named Sheet1, Sheet2 and Sheet3.
